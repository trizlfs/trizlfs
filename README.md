<h1 align="center">👋 Howdy! I'm Trizl!</h1>

<p align="center">
  I was born and raised in The Gem State of Idaho. I'm a avid snowboarder, golfer, and outdoors enthusiasts. I started developing in 2023 to solve my issue of bots that dont fit my needs and standards. I originally just learned Node.Js and Discord.Js to use APIs and a decent looking bot, but that expanded, as less than 2 years later I'm here. Now I use these skills in my personal and academic life, to the point I've made my own APIs, a Volcanic Mapping Site, and more. I hope you enjoy this information about me.
